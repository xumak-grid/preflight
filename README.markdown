# Codename: Preflight

Preflight fulfills the requirements of delivery in the standard four-tier engagement platform. Preflight optimizes delivery of content for proper display on devices, caches content for performant delivery, and drives personalization by using analytics to monitor user behavior. In short, it is a reverse-proxy with filters for delivery optimizations.

The purpose of Preflight is to free developers from having to optimize content for all delivery. Minification, image formatting, compression, etc. are handled as filters prior to delivery to clients.
